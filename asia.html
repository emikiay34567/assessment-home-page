    <h1 class="hongkong">HONG KONG</h1>

    <section id="asia2" class="section">
        <p> The first place I got to visit in Asia was Hong Kong, a very peaceful and safe place with lots of wonderful sights. 
            Since I went during September the temperature was around 27°C - quite warm, yet comfortable for me. 
            I recommend going to Hong Kong during the autumn season as there is less tourists yet nice weather.
            <br><br> To get there I had to take a flight from London and it cost me around £300 (one way), which is what you should expect as an average fare for travelling there. 
            The cheapest time of the year to get tickets ranges from September to November, November being the cheapest with prices such as £298 for a round trip.

            <p>My visit to Ocean Park was lovely, and in my opinion it's the best theme park I've ever been to. My favourite part was seeing the red pandas! </p>

    <h1 class="macau">MACAU</h1>

    <section id="asia3" class="section">

        <p> The second place I got to visit in Asia was Macau, known as the "Las Vegas of The East" for it's gambling industry 
            that surpases that of Las Vegas seven times. A fun fact is that more than half of the region's economy is dependant on this industry.
            Also, did you know that gambling is illegal everywhere in China apart from Macau? <br><br> During my two day stay here in Macau, I got to visit 
            a number of places including the infamous Macau Tower. It has an astonishing height of 338m and it offers the best view of the city.
            It's interesting to note that this tower resembles the Stratosphere Tower in Las Vegas.

            <p>A must visit- the largest casino in Macau. However, make sure you have a map handy as I got lost three times! It's a beautiful place to walk around and it has high luxury shops.</p>

        <h2>My recommendations for visiting Macau:</h2>
        <li>Make sure to go during the winter season, as there's less crowds</li>
        <li>If you're in need of a last-minute activity, go to Fisherman's Wharf, as this leisure compex can provide you with food and entretainment, no matter your age.</li>
        <li>If you go gambling, make sure not to waste all your life savings in two days!</li>
